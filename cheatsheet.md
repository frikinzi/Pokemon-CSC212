Welcome to the world of Pokémon! Below is a guide to help accustom you to the mechanics of Pokémon.

# Pokémon
There are many different species of Pokémon, and each Pokémon has its own properties.

## Base Stats
The base stats of a Pokémon are defined by HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed.

**HP** - The hit points of a Pokémon
**Attack** - Determines how much damage physical moves will do
**Defense** - Determines how much damage the Pokémon takes from physical moves
**Special Attack** - Determines how much damage special moves will do
**Special Defense** - Determines how much damage the Pokémon takes from special moves
**Speed** - The faster the Pokémon, the more likely it is to go first

## Types
A Pokémon species have up to 2 unique types, and these types can be any one of the 18 types available in the game. Each type has its strengths and weaknesses offensively and defensively. As a classic example, Fire attacks are super effective against Grass-type Pokémon, while Grass attacks are super effective against Water-type Pokémon.

Weaknesses and resistances are compounded. For example, a Ice / Grass Pokémon will be 4x weak to Fire attacks, because Ice and Grass are both weak to Fire. However, an Electric / Steel Pokémon will have a quadruple resistance to Steel attacks due to Electric and Steel both resisting Steel.

## Moveset
Each Pokémon has its own unique set of moves that it can learn as it levels up.

# Individual Pokémon Traits
No two Pokémon of the same species are the same. There are many characteristics that are individualized for each Pokémon.

## Nickname
Upon catching a wild Pokémon, you are able to give them a nickname. 

## Individual Values (IVs)
Individual values are like the genetics of each Pokémon, with each stat having a random possible value from 0-31. The higher the IV, the higher the stat is.

## Effort Values (EVs)
EVs reflect the training of Pokémon. When you defeat a Pokémon, certain stat's EVs will increase depending on the defeated Pokémon's species. A Pokémon can have a maximum 510 EVs, and 255 EVs in each stat.

## Moves
Each Pokémon can have a maximum of 4 moves. This means that you must choose wisely which moves the Pokémon can learn.

You can teach Pokémon moves using TMs.

To view information about a move, you may check your Pokémon's summary and read the move's description.

# Moves
Each move has several properties when defined:
**Base power** - a measurement of how strong the move is
**Type** - what type the move is
**Power Points (PP)** - how many times the move can be used in battle
**Secondary effects** - what secondary effects the move may have (i.e. can it burn the target)
**Accuracy** - how likely the move is to hit
**Category** - a move can either be a **Physical** attack, **Special** attack, or a **Status** move. Physical and Special moves deal damage and use either the attack or special attack stat of a Pokémon when calculating damage, while a Status move deals no damage, but has other special effects.

Moves that have a type that matches the user's type will receive a same-type attack bonus (STAB), which means the move is x1.5 stronger. This means an Ice-type using Ice Beam, an ice move, will deal more damage than a Water-type using Ice Beam.

It is in your interest that your Pokémon have a wide variety of coverage moves depending on what moves they can learn, and strategically have status moves!

# Abilities
Each Pokémon has a special **ability** that has a range of effects in battle. These abilities range from lowering the opponent's attack upon switch in, to boosting certain attacks, etc. This makes every Pokémon unique in battle!

Certain Pokémon can Mega Evolve, meaning that they gain +100 in base stats and sometimes change their typing or abilities. The trainer must have a Mega Ring and the Pokémon must hold the appropriate Mega Stone. One trainer can Mega Evolve once per battle.

The list of Mega Evolutions available in the game are below:

## Items
You can use certain items in battle. For example, you can heal/revive your Pokémon using medicine, or throw a Pokéball at a wild Pokémon to try and catch it.

## Winning
Winning a battle grants you a sum of money, depending on the trainer. If you win against a gym leader, you will also be given a TM.

## Losing / Blackout
If you lose a battle, you will black out and be sent to the nearby Pokémon center and have your party healed. If you are fighting a trainer, you will pay the trainer a certain amount of money (1/8 of your current balance). If you are in a wild battle, you will drop the money in panic instead.

# Wild Pokémon
You can encounter a random wild Pokémon anywhere on the map.

Wild Pokémon can be caught using Pokéballs. Different Pokéballs increase your chances of catching Pokémon. For example, Ultra Balls double your chances of catching a Pokémon, while Master Balls guarentee the Pokémon's capture.

Weakening a wild Pokémon (i.e. bringing its HP down) will increase its chances of being captured, but be careful! Should the wild Pokémon faint, you will lose your chance of capturing it.

Inflicting status conditions on the wild Pokémon (i.e. paralysis, sleep, burn, etc.) will increase the chances of it being caught.

Different species have different base catch rates. Some species are extremely difficult to catch (i.e. legendary Pokémon), while others are easy (i.e. Pidgey).

# World
At each location, you can either fight trainers (if any nearby), catch wild Pokémon, buy items from the shop, or challenge a gym leader if there is one in the region.

# Gym Leaders
Your ultimate goal is to defeat the four powerful gym leaders of the region. You can battle them in any order. Keep in mind, as you earn more badges, the tougher their teams will be. 

All their levels will be scaled to the Player's highest leveled Pokémon. 

**Clara:** specializes in Ghost-type Pokémon. Make sure your Pokémon have access to Dark-type moves. Be careful of her Giratina and Mega Gengar! Gives $10,000 and TM Shadow Ball when defeated. Gives out the Nightingale Badge. Challenge her at **Sunspore Forest**!

**Pat:** has a somewhat balanced team, with some speedy Pokémon. Her Lugia, with its high defenses, may be tricky to take down. Gives $10,000 and TM Stone Edge when defeated. Gives out the Panther Badge. Challenge her at **Shattered Dunes**!

**Amanda:** specializes in Flying-type Pokémon. Electric, Rock, and Ice-types will do well here! Be careful as her Mega Pidgeot will never miss a powerful Hurricane! Gives $10,000 and TM Hurricane when defeated. Gives out the Falcon Badge. Challenge her at **Mistfrond Grassland**!

**Emma:** specializes in Fighting-type or high attack Pokémon. Be careful of her Koraidon's high attack. Flying, Psychic, and Fairy-types will do well here! Gives $10,000 and TM Close Combat when defeated. Gives out the Bear Badge. Challenge her at **Rustcry Isle**!

At Needle Summit, there is a powerful trainer **Scarlet** with a Ho-Oh and Mega Salamence at her disposal. Rock-types might be very helpful against her.

Once you have defeated all of the gym leaders, explore the world for some surprises!

You can also rebattle them at their full power infinitely once you have defeated all of them. 

# Legendary Pokémon Locations
Legendary Pokémon are exceptionally rare and powerful Pokémon that can only be encountered after you earned all of your gym badges. Remember, once you start an encounter, you only have one shot at capturing it! The following Legendary Pokémon are in the game, with their locations:
